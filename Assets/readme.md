## Getting Started
The project was made with Unity 2023.2.3f1, and will upgrade to newer versions as they come out. [You can download Unity here](https://unity.com/).

You'll need to install LeanPool from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/lean-pool-35666) - this is used for object pooling, it's a free assets and is used to spawn and despawn objects in the game.
